console.log(eskie.overlay)   // Canvas animations

// Try some out!
let target = Array.from(game.user.targets);

## Want to Contribute?

We'd love to have you! There are (at least) two ways to contribute to this project:

1. Post your own Sequencer animations to the Discord and request integration!
1. Create a PR following the current coding standards:
    - create / play functions exported
    - DEFAULT_CONFIG used as the base configuration
    - Test the animation with token rotation
    - (If integrating with AA) standardized arguments for create / play functions
